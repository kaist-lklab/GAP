wizard_of_internet,"User 1: Do you think that the king of queens holds up as a show that is still funny so many years after it has ended?
User 2: Yes it definitely does. Comedy is timeless.
User 1: How would you compare the king of queens with seinfeld? Seinfeld was arguably a much more popular show.
User 2: Hmm, good question, seinfeld is a great show but not something that I can relate to at all. King of queens seemed much more relatable.
User 1: Do you think the fact that they were both set in new york had anything to do with how popular they both seemed to be?
User 2: Yeah I think so. You could say the same thing for the show friends as well. But I also think king of queens had great acting as well.
User 1: Who was a better character in the show? Doug, carrie, or arthur?
User 2: I think doug was the best to me, he was the most believable since he had a super normal job as a truck driver and all that.

wizard_of_internet,"User 1: It took me an hour to fall asleep last night.
User 2: Sorry to hear that. Sleep is very important. Some say that sleep is when your brain cleans up toxins and impurities that build up during the day. Have you tried any tricks to fall asleep faster?
User 1: I have an app on my phone that lets me choose different sound loops to fall asleep to but it doesnt always work.
User 2: Sorry to hear that. I know that laying still and breathing deeply and slowly helps me. Breath in for 4 secs, hold for 7 seconds, breath out for 8 secs. It might take some practice but you should try it.
User 1: I have tried meditating before with breathing like that but my mind still had many thoughts racing through it.
User 2: It can be tough. How about ""progressive muscle relaxation"". You slowly tense and then relax each muscle group. This would allow your mind to focus on your muscles, and it would slowly relax your body.
User 1: This sounds like something that could work for me so I will definitely look more into it.
User 2: Great. I'm a big movie fan, how about you? I like movies that really make you say huh? Like clockwork orange. What are your favorite movies?

User 2: Yes, I love the office. Michael scott reminds me of an old boss of mine. Same wacky personality.
User 1: Michael scott is almost an archetype for bosses everywhere. I wonder if other characters on the show are archetypes for typical people in the office.
User 2: Absolutely. Dwight is definitely the one who wants the power and has delusion of grandeur. And how about stanley? Just wants to do the minimum and get out of there. Do you relate to any of them in particular?
User 1: I have probably related to different ones at different jobs I've had. Pam sits there and watches the insanity occurring around her. I've felt that way, too.
User 2: Me, too. And her office friendship with jim feels very familiar. It's such a fun show. I was sad toward the end when it changed so much.
User 1: Most shows run out of ideas. They introduce new characters to keep it going. The office was on for 8, 9 seasons? Have you seen the original british version?
User 2: I haven't. A friend of mine watched it and said it was pretty brutal. Not as humurous, but still good. I guess michael's character came off as mean at times, rather than goofy. Have you seen it?
User 1: Yeah. I saw it before the us version was made. I thought that the show just wouldn't translate for american audiences. Because it's a bit more subtle about the humor. Ricky gervais created the show and he's got a pretty savage sense of humor.
User 2: He does. I didn't know ricky gervais created it. I'll have to check it out.

User 1: Yes, I am visiting colorado next month.
User 2: There is a popular waterfall hike at the park. Do you like seeing waterfalls on hikes? To find another hike, are you interested in high elevation hikes?
User 1: Waterfalls are always nice to see on a hike; I would love information regarding waterfall hikes. I would want to do a 14teener hike as well.
User 2: Colorado has over 53 mountains with an elevation above 14,000 feet, so this will be an excellent state for your visit. I recommend staying in buena vista, as it is close to 15 of these.
User 1: Is buena vista outside of denver?
User 2: Buena vista is near a number of cities, but not denver. It's at the base of the continental divide. In addition to hiking, it has great white water rafting.
User 1: Excellent information. How far (miles and time) from denver international airport is buena vista?
User 2: It is approximately 2.5 hours by car. There is also a shuttle bus service available.

wizard_of_internet," the snow or ice?
User 1: I use multimeter to check the tracks.
User 2: Does that help in bad weather? I have seen the tracks get pretty bad when I am working there in the snow.
User 1: Not easy but we use railroad snow plows.
User 2: That is a good idea! Are there special trains for that or do they just add the plow to the front of a train on the tracks?
User 1: One of the first, and most common types of railroad snow plows used was the wedge plow. As its name implies the wedge plow used a simple wedged design, in later years made from reinforced iron or steel. The railroad snow plow itself was usually attached to the front of either a customized rail car of some type with a pilot house attached to the top for the spotting crew. One of the most common types of wedge plows were those built by the russell snow plow company, which began manufacturing the machines after world war I. Developed with a bit of versatility, russells were equipped with wings attached to the outside of what was known as the tongue (the wedge device that actually plowed the snow clear of the track), which could be adjusted. All wedge plows could not propel themselves and required being pushed by a locomotive.
User 2: Wow that's very interesting! I only do electric repair on train crossing signals, so I did not know about train snow plows! Have you ever seen one work?
User 1: Snow plow blades have two main shapes: straight blade and v-shaped blade. Straight blades can be used parallel to the front of the vehicle to push snow straight ahead or turned at an angle to move snow off to one side. Most straight blades can be adjusted to leave the snow piled either to the left or right of the vehicle. V-shaped blades push snow to both sides of the vehicle at once. Both straight and v-shaped blades can be used to back-drag snow. Back-dragging is lowering the blade to the desired level then backing up, pulling the snow flat.

User 2: Ah, a good ol'canadian brand. :-d are you a fan of both their performance wear and ""active lifestyle"" apparel?
User 1: Yes I tend to wear both. They are very comfortable.
User 2: Do you wear any of their competitors'apparel (nike, adidas, under armour)... Or are you fully loyal to the lululemon brand?
User 1: I also wear nike and adidas. I have heard amazon has lululemon dupes as well, but I have yet to try them yet.
User 2: I don't know if you wear yoga pants, but lululemon ""wunder under"" are super soft and have extra material to make sure your privates stay well covered, lol.
User 1: I am actually wearing ""wunder under"" today! I agree they are very soft and move with you.. Do you have a favorite brand?
User 2: Have you heard of yogaaddict? They're super stretchin--great for pilates or yoga... Or just sitting in front of the tv watching netflix. :d.
User 1: Actually yes I have heard or yogaaddict, I have seen the in a few shop around me. I am always on the lookout for great athletic gear!
User 2:","target: The big athletic companies (nike, adidas, etc) of course tend to have great apparel, but there are quite a few smaller ones around that are great to support. Keeping with the yoga pants topic, motivation tights, active knee leggings, and many others are good ones, too.

User 2: It has to be tesla. They are amazing. Have you ever driven one?
User 1: I have! The entire autopilot mode is so cool and unique compared to other companies.
User 2: Oh I know. It's a bit weird at first trusting the computer to drive for you but it's really nice to have that.
User 1: Did you end up purchasing a new tesla, or a different electric car? It's crazy how porsche is looking into electric as well.
User 2: I bought a new tesla. I've wanted one for the last few years. It cost a bit more than a normal car but I think it's worth it. I haven't heard much about the porsche electric car. Is it pretty nice?
User 1: Ya its pretty cool. They released the porsche taycan, and consumers would get three years of free charging.
User 2: I know that tesla has dedicated charging stations but does porsche have those too?
User 1: Porsche has made its own supercharger network, and is in direct competition with tesla.
User 2:","target: It's really amazing to see how fast the infrastructure has grown in the past 5 years. I'm so excited to see what the future brings.
opt-1.3b:  I know. I'm just curious if they have any plans to make their own supercharger network.

User 1: I don't know this brand. Do you have the website?
User 2: Www.ems.com.
User 1: It is the first time that I hear about this brand. What is your prefered material for your spring jacket?
User 2: Fleece, generally. Synthetic. Breathable is normally what I am looking for.
User 1: I have a few north face fleece spring jakets. They are my favorites. North face is frequently in the top 10 of the best fleece jackets.
User 2: How about mountain hardware? I had a fleece jacket from them I loved. Are they still around?
User 1: I never hear of this jacket brand. I never seen it in the top 10.
User 2: They may not be in the top ten at the moment. Or it may depend on the top ten you look at, but they make good stuff. What are the best coats from the north face?
User 1: I like a lot the carto triclimate jacket. It is the best. And you, do you have a favorite jacket from mountain hardware?
User 2: The ascent is a good one. Lite though. How much is the north face carto?
User 1: I don't remember the exact price but it is an expensive jacket.
User 2: Do you know of any lower cost options?
User 1: There is a jacket made by nautice that I saw at macy the other day. It is not expensive.
User 2: What was it made of? Was it comparable to the north face coat?
User 1: I don't remember what is made of but I know it was waterprof and insulated. For sure, the north face is better. They are not comparable.
User 2: Bummer. Finding one at a good price would be nice. Now that I'm thinking about it I need a new rain coat too.
User 1: If you are looking for a raining coat, you should consider also north face. North face is always in the top 5 in any kind of jacket/coat but it is expensive.
User 2: What else is out there at a reasonable cost?
User 1: I remember seeing at walmart a rain jacket not expensive. It is kuhl airstorm rain jacket. It looked to me a decent jacket but I never bought from this brand.

User 2: Titantic is such a good movie, sometimes it hard to think that 1,503 people died on board though!
User 1: I wonder how many of the survivors are still living?
User 2: I do not believe that any survivors left as the last one died at age 97, millvina dean was her name. Do you enjoy movies like titantic?
User 1: I love movies about titanic. I also love all movies by james cameron. Do you know any of his other work?

wizard_of_internet,"User 1: Really like the quality of calvin klein clothing.
User 2: They really have been known for their high quality since way back in 1968 when the brand was launched. Comfort is top-notch, too. Is comfort important to you as well?
User 1: Absolutely, it's probably the most important aspect to my clothing. What I like about the brand is that everything fits well no matter the style. Do you own any ck clothing?
User 2: Their apparel is wonderful! Is your interest mainly in their apparel, or their other product lines as well?--bags, jewelry, towels, shoes, etc.
User 1: It's mostly apparel but I also own some ck dress shoes that I would say have been my favorite over the years. What brands do you like?
User 2: It's astonishing that ck started out with as just a tiny coat shop in a hotel. It sure blew up from there! I too like brands high in quality/comfort... But a lot of them tend to be a bit pricey. :(.
User 1: Yes I agree with you most are too pricey that is why I stick with ck. The clothing works best and it's not overly pricey. What is your favorite article of clothing and what's the brand?
User 2: Yes, ck is affordable (especially considering their apparel takes eons to wear out), and macy's tends to have very good sales on their items frequently. Their 100% cotton ck basic long-sleeved, collar blouse is a must-have staple.
User 1: Yes I agree. Love the underwear, jeans and dress shirts in particular and it last for years. Any other brand you would recommend?
User 2: If you love calvin klein, you'll probably also really like ralph lauren, donna karan, and tommy hilfiger. You're almost guaranteed to love armani and versace, too... But their price tags can be terrifying, lol...

User 2: Oreos have a gluten free option now too!
User 1: These a ton of oreos varieties! 55 flavors, not counting variations like double-stuf. Gluten free isn't a flavor, but if you count all those varients, it's probably 100. One weird flavor is firework, which has poprocks.
User 2: I don't think I would like the firework flavor very much, but I do like the red velvet.
User 1: Yeah, they were hit or miss to say the least! They were only a limited release and there's a reason they didn't take off.
User 2: I agree! I also like the birthday cake oreos.
User 1: That's a good one too. The sprinkles look like they'll crunch in your mouth but then they don't. Opposite of firework. If you had to pick a favorite what would it be?
User 2: Definitely red velvet! Tastes just like cake.
User 1: Yup, a lot more than the birthday cake one taste like cake, not that that's a bad thing.
User 2: This is true. I like the vanilla flavor the birthday cake one gives though. The red velvet is more sweet.

User 2: Yeah I did I havent finished it yet but I liked the back story of the old man that helped saul and walter out I dont suppose you watched the film? El camino im sure its called.
User 1: I have not seen anything about it, but I know the director vince gill also writes for breaking bad. Do you prefer the original breaking bad show over it?
User 2: I still havent seen it myself but I really want to and yeah I prefer breaking bad it had a lot more suspense than better call saul how about you what was your opinion?
User 1: I think breaking bad is the front runner, the story behind walter and jesse is incredible and captivating, especially with seeing the lung cancer story played out.
User 2: Yeah the bond they have gets you so drawn in and I think the lung cancer gave what would be a truly unbelievable story something that makes sense if you get what I mean? People could understand how life threatening times could lead you on a spiral of madness? And thats something vince gill does really well.
User 1: I think that the show having 58 nominations as well as 16 emmy's is pretty outstanding!
User 2: Yes thats incredible I like the use of the nice cars in the series to like the hellcat that walter does rings in.
User 1: The pizza scene where walter throws pizza onto his home, I heard they had stacks and stacks of pizzas to be used for takes, but it only took walter one throw to land it.
User 2:","target: Thats a cool little fact I would have like to been there for some of the free pizza. Hanks final seen was amazing really showed his true character and made people realise what walt had actually got himself into.

User 1: Yes I did I watched the films first and enjoyed them so decided to read the books to find out more.
User 2: It is pretty astounding that the harry potter books have all been translated into german, swedish, spanish and way more languages. Because they are so popular!
User 1: I knew they were popular but I didn't know they had been translated into so many different languages do you have a favourite book out of the series.
User 2: I think the prisoner of azkaban as it had a lot of twists and turns and I love the character development. Who is your favorite character?
User 1: I like the goblet of fire because of all the activities taken place within it, a fun fact about the series is all of the books in the series are within the top 10 most sold books ever.
User 2: Oh that's right, that's when the return of voldemort happened, which was very exciting! Is harry your favorite?
User 1: Don't really have a favourite character as I think all of them play huge parts throughout.
User 2: Since you are a harry potter fan, have you rode the hogwarts express yet? Tickets are $50 for an adult!

User 2: It gets really humid here during the summer - july and august are really sticky! I normally wear gym shorts, they're really comfortable and loose fitting.
User 1: Your summer weather sounds very uncomfortable. I can understand why you would want to wear loose-fitting shorts that let you move easily. My boys like to wear gym shorts, but I haven't worn that kind of shorts in years.
User 2: That's great that your boys wear gym shorts, I bet they're very active and they benefit from the mobility of gym shorts. How old are you boys?
User 1: M shortsmy boys are 12, 16, 18. Only my oldest and youngest sons like to wear gym shorts. My oldest son wears his gym shorts year-round, not just in summer. He likes the basketball-type of gym shorts, the ones that are about 11 inches long. What kind of gym shorts are your favorite?
User 2: I'm a big fan of the 9 or 11 inch gym shorts that come around the knee. I'm a little taller so I need to buy the longer styles.
User 1: I understand needing to buy longer pants and shorts myself. I'm about 5'11"" and my older boys are both 6 feet tall or taller. Do you wear lined or unlined shorts? I would think that wearing lined shorts, especially in a summertime climate like yours, would be uncomfortable.
User 2: I enjoy distance running so I'll wear lined shorts then for running, but otherwise unlined is the way to go for sure.

User 2: My alto and soprano range are okay, other than that will hurt my vocal cord. I will work on to expand my range per your instruction.

User 1: It may indeed be the very same sushi, yes! Back then, when sushi was served as a theatr snack, it may have been served by itself, but today--yes--it's probably the same thing!
User 2: I couldn't imagine going to a theatre show now and eating sushi, that would be great, I guess in japan though this must be more traditional and standard. I really love salmon sushi.

Made up of the world’s greatest super heroes, their membership inflates and contracts around each new threat, but the core line-up is known as the big seven: superman, the most powerful hero in the world; batman, the apex of physical and mental human achievement; wonder woman, the amazon’s princess and greatest warrior; green lantern, an intergalactic cop armed with his own power ring; the super-fast flash; aquaman, king of the seven seas; and cyborg, a half-man/half-robot outfitted with the world’s most advanced technology.

User 2: It's a crime series set in a town in washington where a fbi agent comes to investigate the murder of a girl. It's surreal and there is a lot of abstract elements too which makes it quite a cult show.

User 1: You think so? Lol what about sylvester stallone and rambo? And rocky ha ha.

User 1: And since we're on the topic of 80s heros. I'm pretty sure that arnold is looking to reprise some role. Although to be honest the last terminator with him was actually pretty good and he explained why he looked older in a way that did make sense in the movie.
User 2: They did do that one really well, even though they skipped over the storylines of most of the franchise. It must be difficult to keep a franchise like that going and still have continuity with the plot.
User 1: Yeah I agree. There were some movies where I had no idea where they wanted to go with the plot. It was either they wanted to segue to a different group to continue the franchise or just sheer bad writing. Anyway, I'm glad to see arnold one last time and I hope they put the whole terminator franchise to rest. Which is your favorite movie franchise?

User 1: It is and the best part...'everyone knows your name '. They used to have this orange chicken salad and it was so tasty.
User 2: I have never had an orange chicken salad, I am sure the unique flavors in a ordinary dish makes it unique and worthy of eating? I wonder how they make the orange chicken saude.
User 1: It's a flavorful combination for sure. It's one of my favorite dishes to search boston for before the big hockey game. Something about cheering for the bruins always makes me so hungry.
User 2: Bruins is one of the best teams, having won 6 championships, they have a solid foundation. Would be amazing is ray bourque was still young enough to play with the bruins, bruins would dominate.
User 1: Ray was a beast, but since he was on the rooster, there have been some amazing players. My favorites are patrice bergeron and zdeno chara.
User 2: Dont forget about cam neely and phil esposito! I bet you are a big fan of hall of fame players, which one is your favorite player?
User 1: No one could forget them. Probably cam neely is my favorite. I woud love to go to the hockey hall of fame in toronto. It's always been on my bucket list. Maybe this year, I will make it a reality.

User 1: Actually yeah it is. But I only do it for fun. I write a few times a week. I would rather draw things than write though. Hilariously though, I seriously just hate graphic novels. But I love to draw and read. More than writing......... I think maybe something is wrong with me haha.
User 2: Sounds like maybe you enjoy journaling to clarify your thoughts and feelings? Art can be very therapeutic as well. Is there a connection between your artwork/drawings and the books that you enjoy reading?
User 1: I love to draw dragons, and I read a lot of dragon books. I also sometimes try to draw things I read about. Like in the name of the wind, I tried to draw kothe when he was being wracked and the girl he found under the ground. Oh and his lute. I never would look up what they look like because I wanted it to be special from what I read in the book.
User 2: You must be a very empathetic person to be able to use your intellect and your love of reading to create original artwork. Do you work in a creative field as your day job?
User 1: No. I actually don't get to do anything creative anymore unless I am at home. They made things difficult at work because some people were goofing off and this one person was stealing customer information. So nope. Not at all. I go home and read while I cook, read while I eat, read in the tub, read in my bed. I even read outloud to my pets and my plants. And I draw when I get bored from reading.
User 2: So your job seems to stifle your creativity a bit and at home is where you let your creative juices flow. You must get a lot of comfort from being in your own space where you can let your mind free itself.

User 1: I might try that. Thanks. She might be more willing if there was some of her hair flying free. With my hair, it is long and thick. I usually resort to pony tails because I am in a hurry. What suggestions do you have to quickly style long thick hair?
User 2: For quick hairstyling when your hair is long and thick, consider a middle part with wavy curls. A loose curl helps frame many faces well. You also might try a loose bun, which creates a polished but casual look without an excess amount of effort.
User 1: I like the loose bun idea but am excited about curls. My hair is kind of wavy but does not really create great curls. Is there a way to help bring out the curls in my hair?
User 2: A small amount of styling gel can define curls in wavy hair without drying it out or making it overly stiff. Brush your hair with a wide-tooth comb to separate the strands and dry it with a microfiber cloth. Then use a diffuser to play down the waves and make the curls more prominent.
User 1: I've tried that but I often find myself in too much of a rush in the morning. I would love to find a way to get my hair to just curl more naturally, like maybe go to sleep and wake up with it curly. Until the jetson hair helmet is a thing, I may just be stuck.
User 2: You might want to try the classic curl technique. Wrap the hair flat around your curling iron barrel (one inch), with no spaces between the wrapped strands. Curl it for no more than 10 or 15 seconds, then let it go into your palm to set for several seconds. This may help create those curls more easily.

User 1: Nothing wrong with that, the most important thing is whether or not it's something you're passionate about and enjoy doing.
User 2: That's true, for sure. I have met many people who made a lot that did not seem happy or who did not enjoy their jobs.
User 1: Yeah, freelancing suits me pretty well. I have a hard time sitting still so being able to bounce around and do whatever feels right is nice.

User 1: I like finding old cars and restoring them and then selling them. Although sometimes I fall in love with the old junky ones and end up keeping them myself.
