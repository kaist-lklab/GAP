Provides thousands of pounds of meats to food banks and shelters. Controls invasive species of some animals in different parts of the world. Generates revenue for towns in popular hunting areas and the list goes on really.","Oh wow, I didnt think of all that.

I don't know much about the sport! How do you score points?","The offense scores it, by either running or passing the ball, and they have four chances to advance it 10 yards, or they lose control.

Does each player have a different role to play on the team? Do some kick and some block?","Essentially, yes! There are those who block for the quarterback, who throws the ball to the wide receivers to catch it, or he can give it to the running back to carry it.

I imagine it was a huge part of our evolution.","Yeah, Indians also used to hunt for food, and trade.","Hunting must have been much harder before the invention of guns and bows!","I agree, but so much excessive hunting has also led to the extinction of many animals.","I can imagine! We need to be careful what we hunt. Isn't hunting beneficial for some species though?","It can be beneficial when there are areas there are overpopulated, and you need to control the pests."],"671":["I really enjoyed wearing Cardigan sweaters in the fall or winter.

I usually only watch the SuperBowl with a 6 year old at home.","I dont really have a favorite anymore, football is just a typical sport of whoever gets the most points wins","True, but there are so many different plays and tactics. I know the scoring, just don't understand the downs?","The 1st American football game was played November 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton","WOW I never knew that.

Where is Ireland?","It is near England, right?","I think so...It's an island in the North Atlantic, and I think the third largest in Europe.","I didn't know that!  What kind of government rules Ireland?","I'm actually not sure, but it's divided between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Island, which is considered part of the UK.  I bet it's a beautiful country!","Oh.  I didn't realize it was split.  Why the the country divided?","I'm not 100% sure, but I think it has something to do with the Norman invasion in the 12th century."],"957":["Do you like American football?","Yes, I love American football.

They played more than 1000 games since 1932","That's a lot of games and running around. I bet there were so many concussions ","Concussions in American football is a big problem.

He was an American singer, musician, and actor born in 1935 and died in 1977.","He does play some good music! I didn't know he died! ","Some people think he faked his death. He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century.","Yes, he had some very big songs. Do you know what type of music he played? I have no idea what you'd call it.","He started in jazz, then helped start what we now call rock. He was known as the King of Rock and Roll.","Right, he did play a lot of rock and roll. I heard he did a lot of drugs too1","I heard that as well. Elvis released his first single \"Heartbreak Hotel\" in 1956 which became a number 1 hit in the USA.","I remember that song! How many albums did he have?"],"959":["I love the color green its between yellow and blue on the spectrum","Yeah, it is very nice!

","Green is also the traditional color for Irish and Gaelic cultures ","Nice. Do you know why? I never understood why on St. Patrick's Day people drink green beer. "],"960":["I like to drink protein shakes before my workout.","I'm with you. I do the same! I like to pretend I'm some sort of Greek warrior when I do it and then go train.. because athletes in ancient Greece were told to consume large amounts of meat and wine when training, haha.","That totally makes sense! The meat but not really the wine!","You know how it is, people will take anything if they're led to believe it helps them at all. People have taken herbal concoctions and tonics before--strong men\/athletes--since ancient times, and this includes all cultures, just because they want an edge in strength\/stamina.","Yes this is true!","But you have some smart, logical visionaries in there, too. Like back in the 1910s, you had Eugen Sandow, one of the first to be considered a modern bodybuilder--he advocated everyone in the Western part of the world to simply use dietary control to help out your muscle growth. Common sense does come around sometimes.","Yes, and those principles are still used today. It's like 80% diet and 20% exercise.","But then you'd have people like bodybuilder Earle Liederman saying we needed to use \"beef juice\" and \"beef extract\" to enhance muscle recovery. So, it's hit or miss.","I guess that would be some concentrated protein..","There may be some reasoning to it. I guess if it's not harmful, what's the worst that could happen, right? Irvin P. Johnson, a competitive bodybuilder from the 1950s, around the time when that stuff was becoming really popular, he popularized egg-based protein powders. Probably not far off from what we see now. And then since the '70s and '80s, the market has just increased dramatically for bodybuilding supplements."],"961":["Hello, I would love you to broaden my mind about medical billing","Medical billing is the payment practice within the United States health care.","Ok, is this restricted to the united states alone?","Yes.

Do you like Elvis?","I'm not a big Elvis fan, but I have an uncle who's an impersonator, although he prefers to be called an Elvis tribute artist.","I believe that's what my flyer calls him. I not really a fan but seeing the concert is a little different","I personally don't get what makes it such a big thing.  Like, there's even radio stations that only carry impersonator material.","I'm not sure either. I think it was just a celebrity that was glorified. Still cool to me though","But some people have been impersonating him since just after be began his career. They could have just started their own thing.","I thought they only started after he passed away. Seems odd","Nope, apparently since the 1950's."],"963":["So, you know the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum? It's green and it's my favorite color.

Can you explain a bit more to me?","It's like it doesn't matter if I'm trying to do something positive for myself, or even do something that takes me away from something negative, I just feel like doing nothing.","No motivation or lack of work ethic or perhaps depression?","I don't have any problems with poor work ethics.  I know that my work is always high-quality and I always stay on track in the office.  At home is another story though.","Ok why do you think you are motivated at work but not at home?","Maybe it' because I get paid to work, so if I do a good job there, the money is incentive to repeat certain behaviors. ","Oh ok could it be burn out from work and when you get home you are just tired?"],"965":["I've been to a lot of National Parks, I think Yellowstone was my favorite.  Have you been to any good ones?","Yellowstone is beautiful! I've only ever been to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, but the west coast of the US has tons of parks.","I wish I was on the west coast sometimes.  I feel like I'd spend a lot more time out in nature if I had better choices nearby.","If you ever get a chance to visit the West Coast, I'd recommend Miur Woods in California. It's also a National Park. ","What kind of stuff is there?  Is it a forest or something, or are there a lot of animals?","Yep, it's a huge forest! The National Park Service manages it. It's a protected national monument.","Those are the best.  I'm really happy that people try to protect parts of nature, I'm always worried it'll all disappear someday.","I agree.

The album has to be good then for sure. Do you know anything else about him or Rap? ","He was raised in Compton.","Oh, I'm honestly not sure where that is. Has he been around long, do you know? Was humble his first hit?"],"967":["I knew skiing was a winter sport but I never thought of it as a means of transportation!","Somebody still uses it as a means of transportation? Wow! I bet these people are so fit","It has a history of almost five millennia, so maybe people used to use it for transporation - now maybe only in remote snowy areas.","My parents love skiing during winter. I used to ski a lot too when i lived in Kazakhstan","It seems that it may also have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in China according to ancient paintings!","Really? That's interesting!","Seems early skiers used one long pole or a spear - I guess maybe they were hunting at the same time  lol!","What? How in the world did they balance with only one pole?","Apparently they had one long ski for sliding and one short ski for kicking - so no balancing really i don't guess.","I'm glad somebody thought of using two same length poles :)"]}}
