Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Don Rickles are all truly great actors and the creativity of the Pixar Animation Studios team is really top notch.","It is neat to see how they progressed in the series with the quality.","You're right. The quality of all of Pixar's movies have increased over the years. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that they have long term teams that work together on multiple projects. Further, Pixar, as a company, cares more about creating high quality movies than they do making the most money possible. This is their company's culture and the reason for their continuing success.","I once heard someone erased progress on it like a saved file but someone had it on their laptop or something.","4That is a crazy story. Someone totally deleted Toy Story 2 while it was in development (the result of a badly written program that just started deleting files on their server). But, the project was saved because a woman, who was on maternit6y leave, had saved the movie onto her laptop.  I am sure thy have fixed their back up systems after this.","Yes! and I remember now that is how that story goes.","Pixar has produced 20 movies since its founding and all of the big names have worked with them. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tom Holland, Jon Batiste, Phylicia Rashad, Questlove, Tina Fey.  Have you seen their newest movie Onward with Chris Pratt?","No but I bet it will be good.","Even when there's controversy (for example the body shaming controversy in Pixar's movie Inside Out) everyone agrees that Pixar makes the best movies."],"1":["Danielle Steel is a great romance novelist. I really enjoyed No Greater Love.","No Greater Love is a great fictionalized telling of the sinking of the Titanic. ","Yes you are right. It is so good. I also like to read Nora Roberts Irish series. But Danielle is my favorite.","She has written over 179 books, and is the 4th bestselling author of all time, that's a huge accomplishment. ","Have you read her works? I want to get her latest \"Flying Angels\" next.","With over 800 million copies of her books in circulation you think I would've read one, but no, I have not.","Well you should when you can. LOL. I started reading her books in 1978.","Going Home was her first book, it was published in 1973.","Yes I remember it. I think my ultimate favorite is \"The Ring\". It was during the time of Nazi Germany and all that goes with that. It was very moving.","Since you've been reading her awhile.. any memories of Steele? or has it always been Steel for you with no e at the end?"],"2":["Flip flops are one of the oldest forms of footwear, we have evidence of them going back to 4000 BCE ","Hey that is pretty cool.

I like that you can find them in all colors.","And the materials are usually rubber, foam, vinyl, or webbing, materials that can survive getting wet.","I like that but they are really hard to walk in in the rain and when they are wet.","Yes, sometimes they get all squishy and uncomfortable feeling.","And I think I could turn an ankle yeah you have to start walking very slow its awful.","The typically flat bottom doesn't offer much in the way of arch support, but some brands make good arch support flip flops now.

It is an action movie without hot scenes","There were a lot of problems on the set, and Patrick Swayze was supposed to be Cash, left the project and went on to do Road House instead. ","Kurt Russel and Stallone had a great chemistry!! The movie would not be so good with Swayze","Audiences agree with you, it had moderate box office success and was one of the last films released in the 1980's.","I believe that movie deserved to became a franchise, but it never happened","It still could, they're constantly reworking and revisiting older work in Hollywood, I predict a reboot soon!"],"4":["Justin Bieber is a Canadian who shot to fame after posting videos on youtube. ","He was so pure when he started. He was born with talent.","His first music out, My World, is certified platinum and a year later released My World 2.0 which was certified triple platinum.

That is a big misunderstanding","Right, people are always looking for the easy way out, but trading is a time consuming, difficult to learn, task.

I know Zoya is one.  I loved it too.","The Nightingale is a great novel set in 1825 in Tasmania.","Oh yes I read that one.  I know No Greater Love was set on the Titanic.  It was so good.","How about Heartbeat? Have you read that one? It wasn't rated quite as high as some others, but the Polly Draper is convincing.","I did read it but didn't get into it much.

Yes it's sold everywhere here and I can get it on sale in bulk.","Do you just buy it by the case?","Yes and they have a bonus pack where I get 4 bottles free.  I like it so much better than Dasani. ","Is the price pretty comparable?","Zephyrhills is always a better buy.  I also love Fiji water but it is pricy. ","I think Fiji is one of the most expensive because it comes from such a remote location.","This is true. Do you know any other brands that taste good?  I've tried Smart Water and it's okay.

","She's still going, she has two more books to release.","I think book nine is entitled Tell It to the Bees. Have you read that one?","I'm currently reading book 7, I haven't gotten that far yet. The audiobooks take longer to get through.","Audiobooks is a great way to read a book. So many people don't have access to hard copies or simply hate reading, but love listening.","I have a hard time finding the time to just sit and read, so I listen to audiobooks when driving or doing chores instead.","That's a good time to listen. I hear that students with reading disabilities also benefit a great deal.

It helps me slow down and take in the story more than I normally would with just reading."],"13":["I think for your camping trip you should visit Mount Hood.","I'm not familiar with Mount Hood.

I believe I was thinking of the one Oliver Stone directed.... I see the one you are talking about is from 1932.","Right. The later one with Pacino was written by Stone, I believe, but directed by De Palma. I recommend both versions! I got into Hawks when I was a kid and saw Rio Bravo for the first time.","Sounds like it is worth watching! It also sounds like you are a big movie buff.","Used to teach the stuff! On the credits of The Thing from another World (remade by Carpenter in the '80s), Hawks is listed as producer.

I hear doubling cube is a fun way to play if you're a good backgammon player.","I play the majority of the most popular games you can play on a backgammon board.","That's great, it seems like a chess type game that computer scientists are interested in.","Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games.

I'm not sure of Accident man and others.","Yes, I agree, that was a fun movie. It's pretty impressive fighting off the sheriff and cartel at the same time.","What about the Accident man, is it also interesting like the others?","It is, I think.

"],"21":["I've been looking for another competitive to play lately.","Have you tried joining Xbox Pass to try out some new games each month? ","Oh! I'm familiar with that. I actually have a ps4, I have their subscription for new games every month but they aren't very competitive games.

I've also been looking for a creative game of some sort but i don't know what to choose.","Let me recommend Horizon Zero Dawn then. It is an open world, creative story game with a variety of challenges, including robotic dinosaurs. ","I need to play that! Fantastic suggestion!

Do you like to go to the beach and enjoy the Pacific?","Yes, I do love the beach!  I just wish there was a way to easily learn about beer to help my job.","Natural Light is a common beer. Some people, especially younger people, may refer to it as 'Natty Light'. This is more on the less expensive side, and it is quite easy to drink. Hence its name, it is indeed light.

It must have been a great set to work on. I remember you said that you really liked that director, Nicholas Ray. Do you have another favorite movie of his I should watch next? Amazon recommended I watch \"In a Lonely Place\" next.","I'd recommend both In a Lonely Place, On Dangerous Ground, and Johnny Guitar, a western like none other. Both are terrific. You might also try The Lusty Men and Bigger than Life which have good reputations, but I've never seen them. ","Oh my gosh! I didn't realize he directed Bigger Than Life.

Can you help me?","Sure! The Lancet had a study that indicated grip strength correlates with heart health. They think it may be better than reading your blood pressure at measuring your health.","Wow! That's terrific. What year was that study?","Well, the article was written in 2015 by Caitlin Carlson, and while it does mention the study's findings, it does not mention the year the study was released. What are some key points in your article?","I haven't started it yet. I have to research the subject a bit further before I commit to write it. You have to admit, it's a little counterintuitive that grip strength would tell us anything about how healthy we are and how long we could live....","I think it's really fascinating. That study in The Lancet had over 140,000 people... That's a pretty far-reaching study.","Ah, here it is, but many authors: \"Prognostic value of grip strength: findings from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study\" JULY 18, 2015","That looks like the one! I'm seeing that it was led by co-investigators Dr. Salim Yusuf and Dr. Koon Teo. They even checked different income levels to see if the study findings held true.","That's it! OK, I think I'll make that the centerpiece of my article. Next question: What's the highest rated grip strength trainer?","I've heard using weight plates and doing \"plate pinches\" is really effective. Also doing a \"Farmer's Walk\", holding weights in your hands and walking back and forth is very effective as well.","I'm into strength training in a big way, but I've never thought to improve my grip.

That said, nothing tops the great Cognacs, especially Paradis and such!","Have you tried Martell or Courvoisier?","Courvoisier is my go-to! They've started making a bourbon cask-finished variety that's really tasty.","Have you been able to try the Hennessy Paradis yet?

I want to make sure this bottle lasts a while!","No kidding, I really hope to taste something that smooth in my lifetime."],"28":["At what age did you begin working with the Red Cross?","I was in college, so late teens or early twenties. It's been a central part of my identity ever since.","Is it the humanitarian part of the organization the part that you identify with the most?","Definitely. The fact that they provide assistance to people at times of greatest need is what's so special to me about it.","With Miama being hit with earthquakes as large as a 7.7 magnitude, I imagine the red cross is very vital in the area.","Miami isn't really plagued by earthquakes as much as it is by hurricanes. The city is so flood prone that it doesn't take much to cause considerable damage.","How do you volunteer? Is it in an office or are you out in the field?","A combination of both. Sometimes I'll do some media work for them, proofreading things for their website and such.

Remind me, what's the last major hurricane to hit MIami?"],"29":["How long did it take Truman Capote to write Breakfast at Tiffany's?","That's a very difficult question to answer!

He was a genius, so it wouldn't surprise me.","I think he completed the book in 1978. Holly Golighlty was one of his best characters.","She definitely was! It's too bad that he only wrote so few books. I think he was a perfectionist.","I know. He was only 59 when he passed away. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had lived a more full life.","That's so true. He had a lot of demons, from what I remember. Didn't he have quite a few addictions?","Yes, he was in and out of rehab clinics, fighting drugs and alcohol.","That's too bad. One of my mom's friends actually knew him, and he was supposedly highly variable in his moods. But when he was on, he was apparently a riot!","He also had a lot of famous intimates. Pamela Churchill, ex-wife of Winston, and Lee Radziwell, sister of Jackie Kennedy."],"30":["The Arnold PRess is a great exercise for your shoulder muscles. The twisting motion can increase your range of motion","That's interesting to hear. I always found it to be more effective than other shoulder exercises.

I do them at least twice a week.","Yes, the squat is considered the best by the NY Times, as are the burpee and sprinting uphill","Hmm, I'm sure the uphill sprint is good for weight loss, though I'm not sure how that would impact one's muscles.","Running uphill makes you use your arm and shoulders, which teaches coordination and upper-body drive","Maybe I'll start incorporating it into my routine.

They do get a bit too cerebral at points, and then other points have no substance at all, but I don't really understand the overall hate for the sequals.","It's tough to beat the original. Did you watch the re-release edition in 4K?","That's true, but some do. No I haven't watched it in 4K.","It came out in May 2018 on Blu-ray, all remastered in full HD.

We will definitely see this year though if Georgia Tech is ready.","If we go to a Clemson away game at Atlanta we will bring plenty of $2 bills.  It's a Tigers football fan tradition","Wow I didn't know they did that! Did the 2008 Clemson football team use them then?","They surely did!  I heard the tradition started over a game with Georgia Tech to prove the impact that Clemson fans have on the local economy - to prove they were worth playing.","Haha that's very interesting!

I was just born when he was famous. His book was great though. Learned everything about him. How he partied, dropping LSD and tripping threw life. Crazy life huh?","Yes. The lizard stuff was a bit much for me. Maybe we don't always understand genius, or maybe it was the LSD.","LOL, I agree. It was probably the LSD. He lived a fun live, but died at a young age.

It's great that local farmers can sell their produce directly to customers.","I'm so glad also. It takes a little work setting up a stand and selling my fruits and vegatables a few at a time.

Have  any of the Battle packs caught your eye? The Death Star Troopers and Kashyyyk Troopers sound cool.","They do, I own a lot of them for my display!

It would make me sad if they did since I have been going there before it became so popular. Any idea what they want to change the name to?","Lake Markham! But the bill that's trying to change the name wasn't heard in committee, so Lake Hudson is probably going to remain Lake Hudson!","Oh, that IS good news. Did you hear about the alligator they found in the lake? It was over 6 feet long! They captured it and took it to the Columbus Zoo and now they are trying to find the person who released it. ","Wow, I can't believe someone was keeping a full grown alligator! They might seem like lazy animals that anyone could outrun, but that perception is exactly what makes them so lethal! ","I really don't know too much about them except they remind me of dinosaurs and I don't want to swim with them in a lake. I guess we will find out how they kept it when they catch the person who did this.  How did you learn so much about them?","I used to spend time working at a reptile house! Alligators are no joke, but crocs are even worse, especially nile crocodiles! They'll try to pull in their handler!

I think Annabeth has a natural talent for survival and knowing how to solve sticky situations. ","This is true, however I think her love for Percy would blind her in the end","You're right, but wouldn't that be the same for Percy towards Annabeth?","I believe in the end it would come down to Annabeth saving Percy first, she knows what he means to the world and that she would love him enough to give up everything for him."],"275":["When it comes to important instruments and musical compositions, are you aware of what the lowest pitched parts of the harmony are?","Performing\/analysing Music  An understanding of the musical elements will enable you to understand any piece of music, whether you are trying to perform the piece or analyse it","Indeed this is true. Would you believe that once you are able to identify the musical phrases it is then possible to perform what is called a harmonic reduction for each of those phrases?","However, phrases can be any length. An analogy would be a short declarative sentence - \"Stop!\" \"Come here.\" Musical phrases can be as short. If there are lyrics, look for sentence dividing or ending punctuation such as commas, semi-colons, colons, periods, exclamation or questions marks. Try singing the melody line.","There is a difference between musical instruments in a melody. The difference in roles is for example how the bass supports and defines the harmonic motion making it stand out among other instruments.","Melody, in music, the aesthetic product of a given succession of pitches in musical time, implying rhythmically ordered movement from pitch to pitch.","So true and refreshing to hear. These instruments of the wind family which alter and vary in low tuned versions of different types are the prizes of the bass family.","Rhythm is the regular movement of anything through time, and melody is specifically a succession of tones set to a rhythm. Pitch, rhythm, volume, and tone are the four parameters or dimensions of music. They measure frequency, time, amplitude, and overtones. Melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm.","The pitch and rhythm lead back into how our brain understands music. We enjoy it and what happens is the endorphin release or something much deeper. It's such a powerful thing, both our minds and music.","While there are many different approaches to describing the building blocks of music, we often break music down into five basic elements: melody, texture, rhythm, form, and harmony.","The traditional music is much different as today we have wide spread access and the music spectrum has been altered by the impact of technology. It's so wide spread and accessible, so much learning potential and healing as well. Just like how the brain will show activity on an MRI when listening to music.","Music can be said to be built by the interplay of melody, harmony and rhythm. Melody is what results from playing notes of different pitches - sometimes pitches can be repeated too - one after the other in an 'organised' way. ... Like every living organism, music has a pulse - beats (like that of the heart).","The power music has is beyond our understanding. Just how it can increase areas of the brain such as neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This effects our memory by allowing production of new neurons.","Understanding melodies by their contour can be useful because reproducing the contour will reproduce the melody, even in different keys.","When we think about paying attention, we generally don't assume that music engages that area heavily and can reach peak brain activity in a short period of silence within an actual musical composition. So within that short time period in a song pause your brain is actually reaching peak periods of activity.","Melody is a timely arranged linear sequence of pitched sounds that the listener perceives as a single entity. Melody is one of the most basic elements of music. A note is a sound with a particular pitch and duration. ... It's the notes that catch your ear as you listen; the line that sounds most important is the melody."],"276":["Football have good physical body and timing and then good scenario to create "," The body of evidence for its danger will be too strong and likely too present within that time frame for it to continue in a form anywhere near the game as we know it today.","Life style improve maintain in your house and relatives","Remember to participate in some type of physical activity or activities for a total of at least 60 minutes each day.","yeah game is should depend some life style task","A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun","Maintainance in any task is important"," Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration","Guideness is important to any game for play","Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.

Its origins are ancient and go back to Indu mythology. In Naruto, it is used as a spiritual energy of the body","Yoga and chakra are also very similar in real life.

Both games are quite fun."],"348":["Since you work out so often, do you drink Gatorade? While it may seem out of the ordinary, I've found that coconut water is a good replacement.","I do actually. But I don't drink the regular ones. I go for the Zero Sugar Gatorade to reduce my sugar intake.","Keep up the good work!

What can you tell me about what makes this film so unique?","The movie had unique carnival-esque touches with dream sequences and flying cats.","P\u00e8re Jules's cats are great! The dream following their separation in Paris is plaintive and evocative of desire, very unusual for the period in which the film was made.

Maryland has done something innovative by allowing for Equine therapy. This allows for new and more natural pathways to healing for all ages. Isn't that pretty cool? ","It sounds interesting. Tell me more about it.","This is called MTR. They usually cover all but 20% of the therapy. This allows people to create human bonds with animals and something even more spiritual. They also get to take care of the horses and learn more about independence and calmness in the proces. ","I always feel very relaxed around horses while riding. I feel like my horse and I have bonded already.","It can be like having someone who understands you. Horses do have the power to heal, and their personalities. With enough time, horses even create bonds with humans. Just as horses help us, we can also help them if they have been abused or neglected. This one can be a two way street on tackling humanity issues. ","Oh I hate to hear of animals being abused. I would love to help an animal recover from an experience like that.","There is a Maryland Horse Rescue facility that was founded in 2000. This is one great place you may look to start if it is within your area. I am sure they are always looking for volunteers. ","That sounds like just the kind of program that I would find rewarding! Thanks for the information.","It is run 100% by volunteers, so anything truly helps. Once rehabilitated, these horses are rehomed, sometimes even into those therapy facilites. It is amazing how we can find solutions in the natural ways of the world rather than in conventional creations. ","How wonderful! It sounds like a program that can really make a difference.","Absolutely. Maryland seems to do a great deal with horses and horseback riding from my research thus far today. They even have a horse program that allows people with disabilities to ride. What got you into horseback riding? ","I have always loved horses.

Well its a prequel to the main story line focussing on the first man and the children of the forest, really solidifies the world building of Game of Thrones. Although it won't air until 2022.

","Thats true its only next year, thats true. Season one was about 1 million an episode season 8 was 15 million dollars production budget per episode it was crazy","It's funny that the final season cost so much more than the prior seasons did.  Because that final season wasn't that good in my opinion.  I really felt like they rushed it way too much.  They should have spent more money on the writers and not the production.

It was a little harder to love though, since I was less interested in outer space and vermicious knids and I couldn't understand why Charlie's grandparents wouldn't follow Mr. Wonka's directions.

Many of the city's historic homes, such as the Bernard Corrigan Home, are actually made of limestone. There was so much limestone they often used it for fences instead of wood, so there is still a lot of stone fencing left too.","There is a guy who carves out cavernous structures into limestone using only hand tools.
